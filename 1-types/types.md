## TypeScript Core Types

- `number` ( 1, -5.6, -10; All numbers - No differentiation between integers or floats )
- `string` (`'Hi'`, `Hi`, `"Hi"`) (All text values)
- `boolean` ( `true/false` )


TypeScript's type system only helps you during development (i.e. before the code get's compiled).
The key difference is: JavaScript uses `"dynamic types"` (_resolved at runtime_) while TypeScript uses `"static types"` (_set during development_)
